### "creative-" techpack, as opposed to vanilla+.

This modpack is built upon [Optimized Fps](https://modrinth.com/modpack/optimized-fps), an existing optimization 1.21.1 Neoforge vanilla modpack. Performance-wise, a long menu loading time and poor FPS/TPS is irritating, so many mods for branding and quests are 100% not included. Everything should be fast and smooth, even alt-tabbing.

For playstyle, the arbitrary end goal is to automate every item, block, and mob in a extremely quick/broken manner, while still focusing on aesthetics and building. Here is the list of mods specifically added in mind to help achieve the end goal:

#### Tech
- [Modern Industrialization](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-industrialization) - self sustaining machinery
- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2) - massive storage
- [Mekanism](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism) - broken power generation, even more broken cardboard box for AE2
- [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) - automates some recipes easier
- [Easy Mob Farm](https://modrinth.com/mod/easy-mob-farm) - automates mobs, entity lag free farming
- [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte) - late game items for free basically

#### World generation
- [Infinite Dimensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/infinite-dimensions) - generates custom dimensions randomly of blocks, because sometimes its nice to gamble for late game items
- [Infinity Cave](https://modrinth.com/datapack/infinity-cave) - increases world depth to -128 with large caves
- [William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld](https://modrinth.com/mod/wwoo) - everyone has already seen tectonic and terralith (they also conflict with Infinity Cave)

#### Decoration 
- [Gaming Console](https://modrinth.com/mod/decorative-gaming-consoles) - sitback type of decoration
- [Modern Decoration](https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-decorations-mod) / [ModernDeco](https://modrinth.com/mod/moderndeco) - since we're playing the modern age of tech, decoration should reflect that
- Chisels and Bits - infinite pixel decoration
- [City Craft](https://modrinth.com/mod/rexs-city-craft) - roads and such

#### Quality of Life
- [FTB Ultimine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-forge) - vein miner since time is precious
- [Effortless Structure](https://modrinth.com/mod/effortless) - since building a wall should be easy

There is a multitude of other mods in here to make the world more lively, but the intended playstyle is to build nice structures, giving purpose to machines and their existence instead of out in the open or underground.
